                <p>Three common ways for a prospective owner to acquire a dog is from pet shops, private owners, or shelters.</p>
                <p>A pet shop may be the most convenient way to buy a dog. Buying a dog from a private owner allows you to assess the pedigree and upbringing of your dog before choosing to take it home. Lastly, finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good home to a dog who may not find one so readily.</p>
